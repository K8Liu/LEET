/*
Write a function to delete the first instance of a node in a singly linked list.
The function should return the deleted node, or undefined if the value was not found.

Example: 
Given a linked list:
 
('a' -> 'b' -> 'c' -> 'b' -> 'd')
 
And given a value, 'b', the linked list after calling your function should look like:

('a' -> 'c' -> 'b' -> 'd')

And the evaluated result would be the removed node with the value of 'b'.

How might you remove a linked list value without adding extra properties to the constructor functions?
